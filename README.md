# üåê Cloud-Native Web Application (Flask + AWS)

This project is a backend-only cloud-native web application developed using **Python (Flask)** and deployed on **AWS**. It supports user management features and integrates cloud services to ensure scalability, high availability, and security.

---

## üìå Features

- User management APIs: create, retrieve, update, delete users
- Email verification with AWS SNS + Lambda + SendGrid
- Profile image upload/download via AWS S3
- Secure database operations using Amazon RDS (MySQL)
- Logging and monitoring with CloudWatch
- Scalable infrastructure with EC2, ALB, Auto Scaling

---

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Database**: MySQL on Amazon RDS
- **Infrastructure**: AWS (EC2, S3, RDS, IAM, SNS, Lambda, CloudWatch), Terraform, Packer
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Email Service**: SendGrid

---

## üöÄ Deployment Workflow

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**:  
   Terraform provisions VPC, subnets, EC2, RDS, IAM, ALB, and security groups.

2. **Custom AMI**:  
   Packer builds a pre-configured AMI with Flask app, Python dependencies, and CloudWatch agent.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**:  
   GitHub Actions automates testing, AMI creation, and instance refresh on code push.

4. **Auto-Scaling & Load Balancing**:  
   CloudWatch metrics trigger scaling; ALB distributes traffic and checks EC2 health.

## üîê Security Features

- IAM roles with least-privilege access
- RDS in private subnet (no public access)
- SSL/TLS enabled via AWS Certificate Manager
- S3 objects encrypted using SSE-C (KMS)

---

## üåç Domain Setup

- Domain purchased via Namecheap
- DNS configured with AWS Route 53 to point to ALB

---

## üìä Monitoring & Logging

- CloudWatch Logs: EC2 logs, app logs
- CloudWatch Metrics: CPU, memory, request latency
- Alarms and notifications via SNS
